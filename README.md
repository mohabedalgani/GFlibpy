# gflib
Genetic Folding Open source library

Genetic Folding algorithm is a member of the Evolutionary algorithm’s family uses simple floating points for genes in representing the chromosomes.

The github page presents GFLIB, a Genetic Folding Python toolbox for supervised learning problems. In particular, the goal of GFLIB is to build a concise model of supervised learning, a free, open source MATLAB toolbox for performing classification and regression. 

The GFLIB specifically designed for most of the features traditionally used to evolve in applications of mathematical models. 
The toolbox suits all kinds of users, from the users who implemented GFLIB as a “black box”, to the advanced researcher who wants to generate and test new functionalities and parameters of GF algorithm. 

To run the GFlib toolbox directly to your PC do the following:
1. Install the requirements file: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Install graphviz.msi from this source link: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html
3. Add graphviz bin/ folder to your system path
3. run binary.py for binary classification problems
4. run multi.py for multiclassification problems
5. run regress.py for regression problems
6. change the parameters of each file you plan to run using your concerning parameters and data
